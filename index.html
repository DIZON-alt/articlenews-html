    <title>Sun news: A solar blast reached Earth last night</title>
</head>

<P>Today’s top story: An isolated M1.8 flare has pushed solar activity to moderate levels. This flare, produced by Active Region AR4016, peaked at 11:50 UTC on March 5, triggering an R1 (minor) over an area north of Madagascar. AR4016 has developed rapidly, gaining a beta-gamma configuration, while AR4012 continues to expand. These two regions are now the primary ones to watch for potential flare activity. Meanwhile, a stunning prominence was observed on the west limb, likely from active regions that recently rotated out of view. Additionally, Saturn has entered the field of view of SOHO’s LASCO C3 coronagraph, providing an interesting celestial sight. Stay tuned for more solar updates!>
   
        
    <P> Sun news March 6. Solar blast bring activity to moderate levels

<p>Flare activity jumped up to moderate, with an isolated M flare. The strongest event was an M1.8 flare at 11:50 UTC on March 5 from sunspot region AR4016 in the southeast. It triggered an R1 (minor) radio blackout over an area north of Madagascar.></p>


    <P>Total flares: Eight flares, one M and seven C-class flares over the past 24 hours</P>
    
        <P>Eight active regions are currently on the Earth-facing solar disk. AR4012 and AR4016 show a moderate beta-gamma configuration.  The remaining have simpler alpha or beta magnetic structure.</P>
      
        <P>Blasts from the sun? No new coronal mass ejections (CMEs) were observed in available coronagraph imagery.</P>


    <P>Solar wind: Solar wind speeds remained above 400 km/s (894,775 mph), peaking at 450 km/s (1,07,000 mph) before decreasing to 387 km/s (865,694 mph).  The interplanetary magnetic field (a critical factor in creating auroras)  Bz (north/south component) was mostly northward with brief southward deflections. However, it has now turned northward.</P>
       
    <P>geomagnetic activity: Our geomagnetic field remained quiet, with the Kp index between at Kp = 2 and 3 over the past 24 hours. At the moment of this writing, Kp = 2.</P>

    <P>Whats ahead? Sun-Earth forecast</P>

       <P>low-to-moderate flare activity is expected over the next 24 hours, with a chance of isolated M-class (moderate) flares. The chance for M flares is 45%. The chance for X flares is 10%.</P>
        
        <P>param from the sun? The M1.8 flare from AR4016 is under modeling and analysis to determine if a blob of solar stuff is heading toward Earth.</P>
    
        <P>Geomagnetic activity forecast: Quiet to unsettled conditions on March 6-7 as the lingering effects of a glancing CME blow continue to wane. On March 8 unsettled to active levels are expected as a high-speed solar wind stream from a coronal hole moves into a geoeffective position.</P>
